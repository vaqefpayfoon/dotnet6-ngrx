The canActivate is called when the URL changes to the route and matches the route with the Guard

This guard type is similar to the canActivate guard except that it is called when activating a route child and not the route itself

The canDeactivate guard’s job is to check criteria before leaving this time a route

The canLoad guard is implemented to decide if children can be loaded or not. You might be wondering what’s the difference between the canLoadand the canActivate?
Well, there is a difference, the canActivate exists to prevent unauthorized users from accessing a route, while canLoad is used to prevent the application from loading an entire module or component in a lazy way (lazy loading) if the user is not authorized.
